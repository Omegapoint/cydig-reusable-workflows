## cydig-compliance-copy-of-configs
In this folder are resources with the final config and read me files, these configs are partially implemented on Github and fully implemented in Azure DevOps. Therefore the folder exists to save these readMe:s and configs for when we implement all the controls fully in Github. Right now a partial file with all the controls implemented exists in cydig-compliance.
